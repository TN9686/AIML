This repository contains a set of beginner-friendly Jupyter notebooks, each with four short Python programs. The goal is to help new learners understand fundamental data structures and basic Python logic through simple and clear examples.
1. dictionary.ipynb
Covers basic dictionary operations such as creating dictionaries, accessing values, updating entries, iterating over items, and using common dictionary methods.

2. linkedlist.ipynb
Introduces the concept of linked lists with simple programs demonstrating node creation, insertion, traversal, and displaying elements.

3. list.ipynb
Focuses on list operations including adding, removing, accessing elements, looping through lists, and using built-in list functions.

4. py.ipynb
Contains general Python basics such as variables, conditions, loops, simple functions, and beginner-level logic building.

5. trees.ipynb
Introduces tree structures with basic binary tree examples, node creation, simple traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder), and counting nodes.

6. tuple.ipynb
Explains tuples through short examples covering tuple creation, accessing items, tuple operations, and common tuple methods.
